                <h3>About us.</h3>
                <p>Peak Chalk is based in Sheffield, UK and gets its name from the Peak District, a beautiful landscape
                    with a rich history of both mining and climbing. We are able to cut down on mining, plastic and
                    transport pollution. This is by giving you a very high purity chalk, meaning a lot less is needed
                    when chalking up. Peak Chalk endeavours to have minimal environmental impact, so the beautiful
                    places that we know and love can stay preserved that way.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-wrapper">
                <h3>Why use our chalk.</h3>
                <p>Nearly all climbing chalk sold is from China or the USA. Peak Chalk is French, massively cutting down
                    on transport pollution. Nearly all of the chalk brands we tested have impurities in them. This
                    encourages you to use more chalk than necessary which isnâ€™t good for the planet. In some cases
                    drying agent is added leaving you with chapped hands and fingernails. Peak Chalk has a purity
                    difference of 0.6% to the most expensive on the market. Almost exactly the same chalk, for 1/3 of
                    the price. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-wrapper">
                <h3>Packaging like no other.</h3>
                <p>Peak Chalk's packaging is a home compostable plastic pouch. It is made mostly of sustainably grown
                    eucalyptus trees, and can be disposed of with your food waste recycling. It gives all the benefits
                    of conventional plastic with the environmental benefits of paper. This packaging has also been
                    designed, produced and printed in the UK. This way, Peak Chalk also cuts down on the production,
                    transportation and plastic pollution associated with conventional plastic packaging.</p>

                <h3>Planting trees.</h3>
                <p>We also want to be a force for nature by planting a tree for every kilo of chalk that gets sold. We
                    are working with 'Trillion tree campaign' to make this a reality. Just a little way of saying thank
                    you. </p>
